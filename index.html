    I love using code to create polished, interactive experiences for users. <br />
    <br />
    As a result, my favorite projects to work on are games, simulations, and this website.<br />
    <br />
    I post games online under the name 'Aiet'. You can see a few below.

  <p>
    In high school I made a refraction simulation for a physics class project.
    That project is what made me fall in love with programming, so I thought I'd recreate it here for you.

      In between school and job searching, I've been working on a puzzle dungeon game.<br />
      <br />
      I'm striving to create a solid and believable feeling world in which to tell my story.<br />
      <br />
      This game is made entirely in Gamemaker Studio using GML, a language similar to JavaScript and the C family.

      I'm particularly excited about this feature, the method I use to draw the characters in game.<br />
      <br />
      Multidirectional sprites are both essential to a solid feeling game world and very time consuming to create.
      To address this, I made a script that takes a character skin and maps it onto a tube sprite in the direction the character is facing.
      This results in easy to make, unique sprites that feel very present in the game world.
      This also contributes to the "pseudo-3D" effect I'm trying to achieve.

  <p>
    This game, Integer, was my take on the 'Idle Clicker' genre.
    I liked the basic gameplay loop of meticulously accumulating resources to then automate the task and upgrade your equipment,
    but every game in the genre kinda felt the same.<br />
    <br />
    I tried to fix this in Integer by creating a sort of "machine" that the player interacted with.
    This let me drop the boring menus and text fields that are common in the genre in favor of more interesting ways to interact with the underlying systems.
    You get points by pulling a fun, clicky pull cord. Your primary currency is displayed on a big, red, glowing sign.
    Your secondary currency is represented by a jar full of physics-simulated marbles.
    You can try the full (roughly 30-60 minute long) game through the link below.
