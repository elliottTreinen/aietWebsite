        I love using code to create polished, interactive experiences for users. <br />
        <br />
        As a result, my favorite projects to work on are games, simulations, and this website.<br />
        <br />
        I post games online under the name 'Aiet'. You can see a few below.

  <!-- =============================================================================== REFRACTION SIMULATION -->

  <section class="refraction">
    <p>
      In high school I made a refraction simulation for a physics class project.
      That project is what made me fall in love with programming, so I thought I'd recreate it here for you.

        In between school and job searching, I've been working on a puzzle dungeon game.<br />
        <br />
        I'm striving to create a solid and believable feeling world in which to tell my story.<br />
        <br />
        This game is made entirely in Gamemaker Studio using GML, a language similar to JavaScript and the C family.

        I'm particularly excited about the feature explained in this gif, the method I use to draw the characters in game.<br />
        <br />
        I created a script that maps a simple pixel art skin onto a rotatable tube sprite. This results in a pseudo-3D effect.<br />
        <br />
        Representing my characters in this way creates a unique default style that is consistent across the entire game.<br />
        <br />
        This method saves an incredible amount of time that would have been spent drawing multi-directional sprites.

      This game was my take on the 'Idle Clicker' genre.<br />
      <br />
      While I enjoyed other games in the genre, they all felt a bit too similar. The "gameplay" was always just menu interactions.<br />
      <br />
      In Integer those menu interactions are replaced with more tactile, visually interesting elements.<br />
      <br />
      <img src="img/randomNumbers.gif" alt="the NUMBERS must get BIGGER" class="inline"><br />
      <br />
      Your various types of points are tracked on a large, glaring neon sign and in the form of a simulated jar of marbles.<br />
      <br />
      On top of that, there's a puzzle towards the end of the game that you need to use your points to solve.<br />
      <br />
      This gives the player a solid reason to collect points, whereas other idle clickers just have you collecting points for the sake of points.
